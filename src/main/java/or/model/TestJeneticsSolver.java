/*
 * CROSSOVER
 * The crossover operator is the process in which individuals from the
 * population trade genetic information, hopefully to create a new individual
 * which contains the best parts from its parentsâ€™ genomes. During crossover
 * each individual in the population is considered for crossover; this is where
 * the crossover rate parameter is used. By comparing the crossover rate to a
 * random number, we can decide whether the individual should have crossover
 * applied to it, or whether it should be added straight into the next
 * population unaffected by crossover. If an individual is selected for
 * crossover then a second parent needs be found. To find the second parent, we
 * need to pick one of many possible selection methods.
