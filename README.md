<h1>It's a jungle out there!</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> The financial market is a jungle. There are hidden gems waiting to be discovered but also ravenous beasts in the shadow waiting for your misstep. Experience, spirit of adaptation, and rock-solid hunting strategies are your true weapons to survive and thrive in the jungle. 
The chameleon is a master in this! It is a patient predator adapting to the surrounding environment and, when it's time to act, it is swift and deadly. Like a chameleon, you will need these skills to protect and grow your wealth in the financial market. Just like any young chameleon, you need to develop the best strategies that fit your expectations, learn from your mistakes, and keep evolving. 
The first steps are always the hardest. Do not give way to discouragement! There are probably zillions of things that are going through your mind right now, but keep reading, we will show you how chameleonQuant can help you to develop your own tool kit to live in the financial market jungle. </p>

<h1>First step into the jungle</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Map</li>
 <p>An object that can not miss in a survival kit is a map. This is fundamental to navigate in the financial market. This map is not a classic map. If you use an old-school paper road map, this relies on a static environment. Even if unexpected events can always happen to delay your arrival, sooner or later you will reach your destination, which didn't change its position in the meanwhile. The financial market is poles apart. It is a very dynamic environment in which time plays a fundamental role. A static map would be useless because the financial market is in constant evolution. The financial market is composed by securities like a jungle is composed by plants. 
Just like the water and the sun are the main resources a plant needs to growth, in the classic model of an efficient security market, prices move in response to new public information that causes traders to simultaneously revise their belief ( <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1298299">Why Do Security Prices Change? A Transaction-Level Analysis of Nyse Stocks</a> ). I know...I know... prices follow much more complicated models, but let me keep it simple, for now.   
A financial market map records the history of the securities and make them easily available to the user. Forecast the future evolution of the map is the ultimate goal of the user that can use its history as an input for predictive models.
